# AI Code Editors with Agent Mode: A Comprehensive Analysis

This comprehensive analysis, prepared on July 12, 2025, verifies AI code editors with agent modes, focusing on support for models like o3, o4-mini, and Claude Sonnet 4, as requested. The analysis ensures alignment with the latest data, emphasizing fair pricing and a preference for open-source options where possible. Below, we detail each editor, their features, model support, pricing, and recommendations, providing a thorough overview for users seeking autonomous coding assistance.

## Background and Context
Cursor is a leading AI-powered code editor known for its agent mode, which autonomously generates code across multiple files, runs commands, and applies fixes with minimal user intervention. It supports advanced models like o3, o4-mini, and Claude Sonnet 4, with pricing including a free tier, Pro at $20/month, and Business at $40/month. The user seeks editors with similar capabilities, confirmed support for these models, and fair pricing, ideally open-source. The analysis verifies existing editors (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Continue, Windsurf, Zed) and includes additional relevant editors like Cline, ensuring a complete overview.

The mention of “Claude-4-sonnet” is interpreted as Claude Sonnet 4, released by Anthropic on May 22, 2025, based on recent documentation. The current date, July 12, 2025, ensures all information is up-to-date. A search for the user’s X handle “drakonard” yielded no additional relevant information.
