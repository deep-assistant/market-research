# Comprehensive Analysis of AI Code Editors with Agent Mode (Updated as of August 8, 2025)

This comprehensive analysis, updated on **August 8, 2025**, verifies AI code editors with agent modes, focusing on support for models like o3, o4-mini, and Claude Sonnet 4, as requested. The analysis ensures alignment with the latest data, emphasizing fair pricing and a preference for open-source options where possible. Below, we detail each editor, their features, model support, pricing, usage limits, and recommendations, providing a thorough overview for users seeking autonomous coding assistance.

## Background and Context
Cursor is a leading AI-powered code editor known for its agent mode, which autonomously generates code across multiple files, runs commands, and applies fixes with minimal user intervention. It supports advanced models like o3, o4-mini, and Claude Sonnet 4, with pricing including a free tier, Pro at $20/month, and Business at $40/month. The user seeks editors with similar capabilities, confirmed support for these models, and fair pricing, ideally open-source. The analysis verifies existing editors (Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Continue, Windsurf, Zed) and includes additional relevant editors like Cline and **Junie**, ensuring a complete overview.

The mention of “Claude-4-sonnet” is interpreted as Claude Sonnet 4, released by Anthropic on May 22, 2025, based on recent documentation. The current date, **August 8, 2025**, ensures all information is up-to-date. A search for the user’s X handle “drakonard” yielded no additional relevant information.

## Methodology
The research involved web searches to verify AI code editors with agent mode and support for o3, o4-mini, and Claude Sonnet 4. Key queries included “Cursor AI code editor supported models,” “GitHub Copilot supported models,” “Continue AI code editor supported models,” “Windsurf AI code editor supported models,” “Zed AI code editor supported models,” “Cline AI code editor supported models,” and **“Junie AI code editor supported models”**. Additional searches clarified model names, such as “OpenAI o4-mini” and release details for Claude Sonnet 4. The analysis cross-referenced official documentation, blogs, and community discussions to confirm model support, pricing, usage limits, and agent mode capabilities.

## Analysis and Recommendations
The evidence confirms that **Cursor** and **GitHub Copilot** are reliable choices for support of o4-mini and Claude 3.7 Sonnet, with robust agent modes for autonomous coding. Note that GitHub Copilot is deprecating o3-mini and other models, so users should transition to supported models. **GitHub Copilot** is the most cost-effective at $10/month for Pro, while **Cursor** offers a premium experience at $20/month. Open-source editors like **Continue**, **Zed**, and **Cline** provide flexibility and are free, with confirmed model support through API configurations. **Windsurf** is a strong non-open-source option, with confirmed support for Claude 4 Sonnet and Opus via BYOK, and likely support for o3 and o4-mini via API.

**Junie**, at $10/month for the AI Pro plan, offers a competitive price point but is limited to JetBrains' IDEs. It primarily uses Claude 3.7 Sonnet, with some use of GPT-4o, but specific support for o3 and o4-mini is not confirmed, though it may be possible via API integrations. Users within the JetBrains ecosystem may find Junie particularly appealing due to its deep integration, though they should be mindful of potential quota limitations.

**Recommendations**:
- **For guaranteed model access**: Choose **GitHub Copilot Pro** ($10/month) for affordability or **Cursor Pro** ($20/month) for a polished experience.
- **For open-source enthusiasts**: Opt for **Continue** or **Cline** for maximum control, with model support verified via their documentation or communities (e.g., Discord).
- **For performance-focused users**: **Zed** offers speed and agent mode, with direct support for Claude Sonnet 4 and API flexibility for other models.
- **For JetBrains IDE users**: Consider **Junie** for its seamless integration and autonomous capabilities, but verify model support and monitor quota usage.
